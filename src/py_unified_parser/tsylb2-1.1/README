File:  tsylb2-1.1/README
Date:  August 7, 1996

This directory contains the source code, documentation, and
example/test data for my software to do syllabification.
The main program, "tsylb2", interactively assigns syllable
divisions to a phonetic string typed in by the user.  All
of the functions and data structures are made available here
so that you can package it differently if you want to.
The code was written in ANSI C on a SUN Workstation.
The installation procedure uses GNU's Makefile and distribution
utilities.

Read INSTALL to compile and install the package.  Manual pages
are provided in the 'doc' directory, and algorithm.doc explains
more about the algorithm.
